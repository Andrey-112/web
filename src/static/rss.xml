            <title><![CDATA[DeepMind AlphaGo Zero Explained]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[DeepMind's AlphaGo Zero algorithm beat the best Go player in the world by training entirely by self-play. It played against itself repeatedly, getting better over time with no human gameplay input. AlphaGo Zero was a remarkable moment in AI history, a moment that will always be remembered. Move 37 in particular is worthy of many philosophical debates. You'll see what I mean and get a technical overview of its neural components (code + animations) in this video. Enjoy!

There are 2 errors in this video:
1. At the top of the residual network, it says value layer twice. One should say 'policy' layer.
2 The residual network is 40 layers, i say 20.

About the Course
Edureka's Deep learning with Tensorflow course will help you to learn the basic concepts of TensorFlow, the main functions, operations and the execution pipeline. Starting with a simple “Hello Word” example, throughout the course you will be able to see how TensorFlow can be used in curve fitting, regression, classification and minimization of error functions. This concept is then explored in the Deep Learning world. You will evaluate the common, and not so common, deep neural networks and see how these can be exploited in the real world with complex raw data using TensorFlow. In addition, you will learn how to apply TensorFlow for backpropagation to tune the weights and biases while the Neural Networks are being trained. Finally, the course covers different types of Deep Architectures, such as Convolutional Networks, Recurrent Networks and Autoencoders.

Why Learn Deep Learning With TensorFlow?
TensorFlow is one of the best libraries to implement Deep Learning. TensorFlow is a software library for numerical computation of mathematical expressions, using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow between them. It was created by Google and tailored for Machine Learning. In fact, it is being widely used to develop solutions with Deep Learning. 

Machine learning is one of the fastest-growing and most exciting fields out there, and Deep Learning represents its true bleeding edge. Deep learning is primarily a study of multi-layered neural networks, spanning over a vast range of model architectures. Traditional neural networks relied on shallow nets, composed of one input, one hidden layer and one output layer. Deep-learning networks are distinguished from these ordinary neural networks having more hidden layers, or so-called more depth. These kinds of nets are capable of discovering hidden structures within unlabeled and unstructured data (i.e. images, sound, and text), which constitutes the vast majority of data in the world.

            <description><![CDATA[We all work in our respective silos when writing JavaScript, be it a framework or library. After a few years working as a Front-end dev, I looked at a list of "JS interview" questions and realized that I couldn't answer many of them (at least not well). So I set out on a long, somewhat lonesome journey of JS discovery, and am pleased to share my findings with you, in the form of a talk.

Regardless of how you feel about getting asked random questions meant to trick you up in an interview (you should be appalled), my talk will cover some basic JS subtleties, and hopefully fill in some knowledge gaps w/r/t:
- Hoisting and variable scope
- Expressions v. statements
- Undeclared v. undefined v. null
- Equality comparisons
- How to properly walk out if an interviewer asks you to do fizz buzz

This talk was given at Nodevember 2016 by Russell Anderson.

This is the part of Service Fabric where Simulated Annealing is done to optimize and balance the "heat" distribution among nodes (so, no node does too little work (cold) nor too much work (hot) - balance is important - it's really Zen). You first heard about our use of a metallurgical algorithm during the Gopal interview.

PRODUCTION FLUTTER'ING
Beginner / Cross-Plattform Development / Talk

End of 2017 we were about to start work on a completely new app that should lay ground for our whole companies mobile app strategy for the years to come. We decided to join forces of our two existing native mobile app developer teams and use Flutter Google’s new cross-platform framework for Android and iOS. Advantages like really well working hot-reload complete code sharing for both platforms and a modern reactive ui framework are just too good to be ignored. But Flutter is still in an early state and with that has its teething troubles and also very own shortcomings. In the first part of this talk I want to share the overall experience we made building our very first Flutter app and running it in production for over 3 months. The second half then goes full into live coding mode to show one of Flutter’s strengths: the easiness to build a fully customized animated graph the visual highlight of our still small but beautiful app. After the talk you hopefully have a better picture of what Flutter is capable of its state of maturity and which use-cases it’s already great to be taken for.]]></description>

Intermediate / Android Architecture / Talk

Handling an SQLite database in Android implies challenges like: a lot of boilerplate code, database operations on the main thread, queries checked at runtime and especially unmaintainable code. At Google I/O 2017, the Android team launched Room, an SQLite object mapper, that provides a set of components and features that will solve all these challenges and will help us, the developers, to have a better experience when using a database in our app. The presentation will include examples about how to use the main components from Room (@Entity, @Dao, @Database), how to handle the relations between the entities, how to use the (observable) queries and not run database operations on the main thread. Also we will discover more details about the migration support, compile time query verification and what’s happening behind the scenes.]]></description>

MASTERING THE ART OF A/B TESTING AND BEYOND
Intermediate / Design / UI/UX / Talk

In today’s user centric world where companies try their level best to win their users’ hearts, it has become indispensable to capture each and every user data point in order to make data driven decisions. While planning new features it becomes very confusing if you have a lot of variations in mind. No matter how good your hypothesis be, ultimately its the users, their mindset, their behaviour, their habits which govern the validity and correctness of your feature. A/B Testing transforms “I guess, I suppose to I know” by letting us distribute different versions of our product among users and determine in real time which version emerges as the leader. We can then roll out that version to all the users. From learning What is A/B Testing, Why is it needed, Fundamental blocks of A/B Testing to diving deeper into A/B Testing Stuff Designers should know, different A/B Testing Platforms available with some quick exploration of two of them, we will ultimately draw some important conclusions like When not to A/B Test, avoiding Common A/B Testing Mistakes and some of the Best Practices. So my dear Designers Design and my beloved Developers Devise, With A/B Testing Let’s All Rise!]]></description>

PERSISTENCE AS THE SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH
Android Architecture, Talk, Intermediate

Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated.
In the world of Android, where all sources of information and user interactions are asynchronous, UI state can become hard to reason about, especially in large apps. This is not only difficult to maintain but also increases complexity with the addition of every new feature.
This talk will explore the idea of “persistence as the single source of truth” as a way to simplify state management, where persistent storage becomes the source for all data changes, and the UI is reduced to a reactive representation of persisted data. This forces the flow of data to be unidirectional which makes it easy to follow. The pattern is architecture agnostic and can be used in any MV-anything.We’ll see other benefits of persistence where screens can stop exchanging data through serialized Bundles, get state restoration across Activity recreations for free, and deliver offline support out-of-the-box where all UI interactions receive immediate feedback and the user is never forced to wait.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Tomek Polanski, Software Developer, Groupon

I CONVINCED GROUPON TO FLUTTER. DO SAME WITH YOUR COMPANY!

Flutter is a new cross-platform mobile application solution from Google. While its touted benefits like the speed and the simplicity to create cross-platform applications sound appealing and you might be keen to adopt it, your team might be hesitant to adopt it because of perceptions of risk and uncertainty as the solution for your real-world app. I will tell my story about how I convinced my team at Groupon to try out Flutter. How highlighting the benefits, whilst being fully transparent about the risks will strengthen your argument.
Next, we will help you address your team’s concerns; starting with fellow developers through to management. I will share how to get the whole team onboard, by showing your:
Designers; how to make a beautiful application
QA; how to make your application more robust
Developers; how easy and captivating is to use Flutter
Product owners; that Flutter is feasible for product goals
Finally, I will share some of the challenges while integrating Google’s cross-platform framework into an already existing application and how we tackled them.
After the talk, you should know if your team would benefit from Flutter, and if it does - how you can convince your colleagues.]]></description>
