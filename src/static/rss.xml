            <title><![CDATA[Progressive Web Apps and the Internet of Things]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[The gap of what the web can do versus what must be done in a native application is really small these days.

I'd like to show that progressive web apps (offline support, push notifications, manifest, etc) are just the beginning. We can leverage newer hardware and networking APIs to build all sorts of Internet of Things types of applications.

This could possibly connect some of the dots for attendees that have ideas for software they'd like to build, but not necessarily understand just how far the web has come.

I would briefly touch on PWAs in general, then move on to transport streams (sockets, p2p, etc) and how they enable communication, then move onto hardware APIs (bluetooth, USB, MIDI, etc) and how we can use the browser and isomorphic libraries (noble, johnny-five, etc) to tie things together.

            <title><![CDATA[GraphQL in Python and Django]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[In this talk, I’ll talk about GraphQL, a data query language created by Facebook as an alternative to the widely used REST. I’ll list the key differences between the twos and pros and cons of GraphQL over a “traditional” REST API. 

I’ll tell why GraphQL has been created, what problems does it solve and how to create GraphQL APIs with Python with an additional follow up on how to use it with Django, one of the most popular web framework. If we have enough time I’ll touch on advanced topics like authentication, caching, security and real-time. 

Takeaway: the objective of the talk is to have an introduction on GraphQL, understand why and when to use it and, finally, how to use it Python.

            <description><![CDATA[In this episode, Filip and Matt start by erasing some of the technical debt that the Hacker News reader app accumulated in the past 3 episodes. They remove the new keyword everywhere, delete unused files, and re-enable unit tests.

Then they set out to tackle state management and separation of concerns between view logic and business logic. They choose to follow the BLoC pattern, using Streams and ReactiveX (rxdart).

With that in place, they implement a new feature: ability to switch between the listing of top and new stories.

Customer Review: 
Michael Harkins, System Architect, Hortonworks says: “The courses are top rate. The best part is live instruction, with playback. But my favourite feature is viewing a previous class. Also, they are always there to answer questions, and prompt when you open an issue if you are having any trouble. Added bonus ~ you get lifetime access to the course you took!!! ~ This is the killer education app... I've taken two courses, and I'm taking two more.”]]></description>
