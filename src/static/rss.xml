            <description><![CDATA[ClojureScript is a functional programming language (a Lisp, to be specific) that can be used to develop web frontends and node.js apps in lieu of JavaScript. I'd say it's currently the best way to develop web frontends, but the language is only one part of it.
The development environment that's grown up around it is what truly makes it shine, whether it's hot reload with Figwheel, instant evaluation of any piece of code in the context of your app state in a REPl, a la carte typing with clojure.spec, or the client-side database Datascript. We'll also take a look at how ClojureScript forces you to write code in a physically completely different way and why that's a good thing along with some of the most useful language features. Buckle up!]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Phil Karlton famously pointed out that one of the only two hard things in Computer Science is naming things. While many of us dismiss naming as Programming 101 material, the names we choose can have a major impact on the cost (and sanity) of future development.

Drawing on over a decade of API development, this lightning talk attempts to put a dent in one of the industry's most difficult and long-lived challenges -- in just ten minutes!

In addition to real-world (and sometimes embarrassing) examples of what NOT to do, this talk includes tips and suggestions for finding names that stand the test of time.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[The Internet of Things (IoT) allows us to optimize and improve most aspects of modern life at an unprecedented scale. As billions of IoT devices unleash billions of dollars in economic value, the tremendous potential of the IoT is also attracting malicious adversaries and attackers.
To achieve secure IoT devices and thwart attacks, it is necessary to ensure upgradability across all IoT end nodes. The longevity of IoT devices, combined with rapid advances in knowledge and tools used by adversaries, makes it infeasible to design devices that will remain sufficiently secure at any security level for their lifetime. Therefore, for devices to remain secure, it is necessary to ensure that their security is upgradable via software updates.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Safely handling data that contains sensitive or private information about people is a multi-million dollar problem at many companies. It adds time into the data engineering process, it can cost a lot in software licenses for specialised tools, and brings a range of reputational and legal risks.

Recent advances in deep learning have prompted an interesting way to attack this problem. By fitting a certain class of model on a source data set that contains sensitive information, we can produce a generator that outputs a supply of synthetic "look alike" data. This output data will preserve many of the statistical relationships between fields as the source does, and offers mathematical guarantees around the identifiability of individuals in the source data set.

This talk will provide an overview of the approach and show how it can speed data engineering effort and reduce risk.

Tim is a Director at Verge Labs, a new type of AI company focused on the applied side of machine learning. At Verge Tim sifts through the daily firehose of theoretical research and builds a curated library of techniques and utilities ready to be switched on at companies today. 
 
Prior to this Tim spent six years absorbed in machine learning and data related roles in financial services tech companies including Atlassian, Spaceship and Airtasker.

            <description><![CDATA[From CSV, to JSON, to YAML, DER, and the dreaded XML, many programmers are dealing with data formats all day. In statically-typed languages like Haskell, we can get a great benefit by imposing a rigid structure of types on the data we consume from these formats. We call this process of imposing structure on data "decoding".

Decoding libraries are available in many languages and for many formats. This talk explores the design decisions behind a new Haskell library, sv, which decodes CSV and similar formats such as PSV. sv addresses what we perceived as problems with other libraries. We will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of the interesting or noteworthy choices made in sv's philosophy and design, and make recommendations as to how these lessons could be applied to other formats.

George is an enthusiastic programmer working at the Queensland Functional Programming Lab within Data61/CSIRO. George loves working with and speaking about Functional Programming, usually in Haskell. George is also a co-organiser of the Brisbane Functional Programming Group, and a member of the Haskell.org committee.

Customer Review: 
Michael Harkins, System Architect, Hortonworks says: “The courses are top rate. The best part is live instruction, with playback. But my favourite feature is viewing a previous class. Also, they are always there to answer questions, and prompt when you open an issue if you are having any trouble. Added bonus ~ you get lifetime access to the course you took!!! ~ This is the killer education app... I've taken two courses, and I'm taking two more.”]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Protecting Encryption Keys with Azure Key Vault - Stephen Haunts]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[In a world where we are putting our companies data in the cloud, the protection of that data against a data breach has never been more important. In this talk I will show you how to setup and use the Microsoft Azure Key vault to protect your encryption keys and secrets like passwords and connection strings. Azure Key Vault uses the power of Hardware Security Modules (HSM's) to protect your secrets and make sure your solutions are as secure as they can be when working in regulated industries like healthcare, financial and insurance.
As well as showing you how to setup and configure the vault, I will show you how to code against it and various different patterns for security in a cloud base multi tenant environment. I will cover topics like:

• Setup Azure key Vault
• Authorize your application to access the vault with AzureAD
• Accessing the vault from your applications
• Using the Vault to wrap local encryption keys for performance
• Encrypting connection strings as Key Vault secrets to get flexible database routing in the cloud
• Audit logging for compliance

Once this talk is finished you will walk away with everything you need to start using Azure Key Vault today.]]></description>
