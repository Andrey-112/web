            <description><![CDATA[Have you ever accidentally determined the size of a pointer instead of the number of elements in an array and spent hours debugging? You want to avoid this in the future? Then you should visit my presentation.
Type safety is one of the most valuable things we have in programming. A strongly typed system helps us write more robust code and detect errors at compile time. A quality that we definitely want in critical systems. The type system of C++ is great for this! However, there are some tasks that are often ignoring the type system. For example, determine the number of elements in an array. For years, an excellent way to give yourself or others a headache.

The C++ Standards since C++11 offer us new valuable elements such as constexpr. This functionality allows us to perform calculations at compile time. That's exactly what we need for our type-safe implementation to get the number of elements in an array.

In this talk I will show you how to implement such a feature. Spoiler alert: It is harder than you might expect!]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[So you’ve been left with a huge bowl of spaghetti bolognese, also known as legacy code. You know you need to break it up to make it more maintainable and more workable. You’re sure there are some good places to make your cuts, but every time you pull on a code thread you end up with more spaghetti code!
NDepend can help with this.

In this talk I will show you how to use NDepend to effectively visualise your code, find the seams and break down that giant monolith into manageable pieces. And I will show you the kind of improvements my team at Page Up have been able to make with these techniques]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Why did we design an Integrated Circuit, IC, in-house from scratch and what made us design our own wireless protocol instead of using [insert buzzword here]?
We often hear that the number of connected devices will reach into the tens of billions within just a few years. If you take a moment and try to imagine the type of sensor solution, from the actual sensor to the API, that can drive such a tremendous growth, what would it look like?

While Cloud Processing and Cloud Storage with built-in extreme scalability is increasingly a commodity, extremely scalable sensor solutions are not. In this talk, I will explore the concrete architectural and design decision, from hardware to API, that we have made to create a scalable sensor solution. To drive my point home, I will briefly touch on everything from graphs of power consumption to wireless network topologies as well as running Docker on embedded devices.

All of these complex design decisions and compromises need to be made to pave the way for a simple and intuitive user experience outside the screen.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Wouldn’t it be nice if we had a standard C++ type to represent strings ? Oh, wait... we do: std::string. Wouldn’t it be nice if we could use that standard type throughout our whole application/project ? Well… we can’t ! Unless we’re writing a console app or a service.
But, if we’re writing an app with GUI or interacting with modern OS APIs, chances are that we’ll need to deal with at least one other non-standard C++ string type. Depending on the platform and project, it may be CString from MFC or ATL, Platform::String from WinRT, QString from Qt, wxString from wxWidgets, etc. Oh, let’s not forget our old friend `const char*`, better yet `const wchar_t*` for the C family of APIs…
So we ended up with two string types in our codebase. OK, that’s manageable: we stick with std::string for all platform independent code and convert back-and-forth to the other XString when interacting with system APIs or GUI code. We’ll make some unnecessary copies when crossing this bridge and we’ll end up with some funny looking functions juggling two types of strings; but that’s glue code, anyway… right?
It’s a good plan... until our project grows and we accumulate lots of string utilities and algorithms. Do we restrict those algorithmic goodies to std::string ? Do we fallback on the common denominator `const char*` and lose the type/memory safety of our C++ type ? Is C++17 std::string_view the answer to all our string problems ?
We’ll try to explore our options, together, with a case study on a 15 year old Windows application: Advanced Installer (www.advancedinstaller.com) - an actively developed C++ project, modernized to C++17, thanks to clang-tidy and “Clang Power Tools” (www.clangpowertools.com).]]></description>
