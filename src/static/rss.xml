            <description><![CDATA[In this episode, Andrew and Matt pick up the app (a Hacker News reader) where Andrew and Filip left off. With built_value now in the app, they can add all the other properties to their article object. Their goal is to deserialize the Hacker News API with this object and pull all fields of information into their app.

            <title><![CDATA[Functional Programming: Type Systems]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[What comes to your mind when you hear the word "type"? Do you think of an integer or string? Do you think of an object type from your favorite OOP language? Do you think about never ending religious debates regarding static vs dynamic types? Do you realize that these things hardly scratch the surface of what it means to be a "type"? Be prepared to understand types on a whole new level. 

In this talk, we will explore type systems. What is a type system? Why are type systems important? How have type systems been influenced by functional programming, category theory, and type theory? We will talk about variance, polymorphisms, higher-kinded types, existential types, algebraic data types, and type classes. 

We will scratch the surface of type theory and learn how logic systems have influenced programming language design.

            <description><![CDATA[Want to watch more videos about Methodology? Click here: https://vimeo.com/album/4414351

For too long we've lived under the tyranny of n-tier architectures. Building systems with complicated abstractions, needless indirection and more mocks in our tests than a comedy special. But there is a better way - thinking in terms of architectures of vertical slices instead horizontal layers. Once we embrace slices over layers, we open ourselves to a new, simpler architecture, changing how we build, organize and deploy systems.

            <description><![CDATA[Want to know more about Database? Click here: https://vimeo.com/album/4414343

Want to roll out a database active active over multiple datacenters? Want to be able to do rolling upgrades and software releases without downtime? How about scale to millions of durable writes a second with single digit millisecond response times.;These requirements really cut down your database choices, and any database you’re considering are probably heavily influenced by Amazon’s 2007 paper: Dynamo: Amazon’s Highly Available Key-value Store. ;In this talk we’ll go through the main parts of Dynamo and discuss them in the context of how Apache Cassandra has implemented them. We’ll cover:; Consistent hashing; Strategies for replication; Working out distributed state with Gossip; Recovering from failure with Hinted handoff and Anti-entropy repair;We’ll also talk about why picking a masterless architecture, and trading availability and partition tolerance for consistency really can lead to a linearly scalable database.

            <description><![CDATA[I will review the state of quantum computing research, focusing on leading technologies and approaches. One approach in particular, topological quantum computing, is poised at the forefront of physics. This approach aims to create a new kind of delocalized state in a condensed matter system, the so-called Majorana zero mode, that will allow quantum information to be manipulated by braiding particles around one another. The state has been found. Can it be braided?

            <description><![CDATA[Rx (Reactive extensions) is a powerful API for Asynchronous programming. It has a steep learning curve. Surprisingly though, the easiest way to grasp the concepts is by examples. So in this talk, we'll look at just 3 examples. These are marginally complex requirements that most developers would run into these days. We dissect the problem using Rx and try to come up with elegant and simple solutions to an otherwise complicated problem.

            <description><![CDATA[Want to learn more about .NET? Click here: https://vimeo.com/album/4413645

You've spent months re-architecting your monolith into the new microservices vision. Everyone gathers around to flip the switch. You navigate to the first page...and nothing happens. Refresh...still nothing. The site is so slow, it won't respond for minutes. What happened?
In this session, I'll walk through a post-mortem of a real-life microservice disaster. I'll show the modeling, development and production problems we found, and how we slowly morphed the new distributed monolith into our final picture of sanity. While we can't prevent project failures, we can at least identify problems early on in our design so that our final product results in a clean, robust distributed system.

            <title><![CDATA[Øredev 2017 - Bartosz Milewski - The Earth is Flat: Exploring the Limits of Science]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[The scientific method has been extremely successful, leading to exponential growth in our understanding of the Universe. But in real life no exponential can go forever. We will either explain everything in one grand unified theory, or we'll hit the wall. We hope for the former, but have to be prepared for the latter.

So far "understanding" meant decomposing complex systems into simpler components. That's what math is good for, and category theory in particular. That's how we write programs. But there is a new way of dealing with problems by training neural networks. Does that lead to "understanding" though? Is AI the killer of the scientific method?

Key takeaways
I will try to maximally confuse and humble you.
You will start doubting your most basic assumptions.
You might get some new insights into the interplay between the human mind and the Universe.

            <description><![CDATA[Noah was the 7th employee at Lucasfilm Games, and came on before their first titles were published. He will relate stories of what it was like to work on early titles like Rescue on Fractalus, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, The Secret of Monkey Island, and more. He'll discuss details of what it was like to code for 1 mhz processors and fit a game into 48K (or even 2K!) of total storage, and relate anecdotes of early LucasArts experiences.

Key takeaways
What it was like to work at Skywalker Ranch with George Lucas and Steven Spielberg in the early days of video games on Star Wars and Indiana Jones titles
Inside stories of early days of game development and coding in the era of 1 Mhz processors and 300 baud modems
Background on groundbreaking interactive storytelling

Through live code demos, you will leave this session understanding advanced development topics like Hand Proximity Interactions to create even more compelling HoloLens applications. Rene will demonstrate some of the apps he and his team worked on since 2015, and share how they were able to overcome challenges. 

His best practices and recommendations will help you avoid pit falls, and show you how to take your own Mixed Reality apps to the next level.

Key takeaways
Why Mixed Reality is not just Augmented Reality.
How to write advanced HoloLens apps.
How to be more efficient while developing Mixed Reality apps with Unity.
What Rene's team has learned developing for the HoloLens since 2015.

            <description><![CDATA[How can we build websites with scalable development (autonomous teams), great end-user performance and high future evolvability?

With this talk, I want to show you that server-side transclusion – in particular Edge Side Includes – is a great integration technique for the above goals. Teams can produce pages and/or fragments, and fragments in turn depend on resource fragments for styles and (possibly) scripts. But how should teams agree on common dependencies and what would the existence of common dependencies mean to evolvability and performance?

Examples will be from the mobile web project IKEA M2.

Key takeaways
The benefits of microservices apply to the frontend as well.
The constraints are bit different though since part of the runtime is a diverse set of end-user devices.
Edge Side Includes is a highly underrated technology for web frontend integration.

            <description><![CDATA[Want to learn more about Agile? Click here: https://vimeo.com/album/4413663

Why do so many IT projects fail? And what can we do about it?
Most companies and organisations know (or at least have heard) that they should work in a more agile manner. But it's generally a hard sell to the people in charge. This talk dissects the agile practices from an economic standpoint, showing that it actually makes business sense even if the project itself was to fail.
By adjusting the metrics from what is easily measured to what actually matters, we can create the correct incentives for producing real value.
