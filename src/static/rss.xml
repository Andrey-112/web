            <description><![CDATA[PyData Berlin 2018 

Did you ever try to scare a fish by tapping on the glass of an aquarium? What happens in the fish brain if you do that? What would happen in a fish school? In my project I tried to answer these questions via computational modelling and I will tell you how packages such as numba, pypet, and matplotlib allowed me to efficiently simulate the model and visualize results in a reproducible way.

I would like to show how I have been using Python and its data science tools to interpret large datasets retrieved from modern equipment used in neonatal intensive care, mechanical ventilators and patient monitors. I also would like to talk about my journey to Python: why it is important for professionals without computational background to learn coding and how I think it is the easiest to do it.

I will discuss machine learning as it is applied to healthcare. The particular focus of my talk is on the limitations of pure machine learning approaches when it comes to biological systems. I will compare this with pure mathematical model-based approaches, which on the one hand appear more suitable but ultimately have their own attendant set of problems. I will finish up with hybrid approaches.

There is an abundance of easily mineable text data (Whatsapp, twitter, and even our own e-mails!), and we have no excuse to not analyse it. In this workshop, we will learn some tips and tricks to deal with messy text data, before moving on to some lesser looked at text analysis techniques, such as text summarisation, working with distance metrics, and an old personal favorite - topic models.

Ethereum is a Turing complete Blockchain. Instead of just processing transactions like Bitcoin, the Ethereum Virtual Machine can run programs. There is one catch regarding any code that is deployed: Fixing errors is almost impossible. Hence, testing becomes incredibly important. The beauty of Unittesting in Ethereum? You can do it in Python and I will show you how.

With the latest release of Pandas the ability to extend it with custom dtypes was introduced. Using Apache Arrow as the in-memory storage and Numba for fast, vectorized computations on these memory regions, it is possible to extend Pandas in pure Python while achieving the same performance of the built-in types. In the talk we implement a native string type as an example.

In the recent times, several meta-algorithms in deep learning have opened up the possibility to use Computer Vision in various applications. Particularly in the field of Object detection, Semantic Segmentation and Instance Segmentation there has been a steady improvement in algorithms like Faster R-CNN, SSD, YOLO, MASK-RCNN. When to apply what and how to leverage those in real-world applications?

            <description><![CDATA[“Hey boss, we made a totally rad deep learning algorithm! It trawls through the internet and literally tells the future!”

“Yeah, cool. But do you have a plot I can show the board?”

Data visualisation is the capstone of data science. As businesses collate massive and disparate data streams, and as algorithms become more complex, communicating results has become more important and more challenging than even before. We need to to start placing as much importance on accessible visualisation as we do on database architecture or algorithm design.

In this talk I will present some core visualisation principles that I have developed over 15 years of experience visualising (literally) astronomical datasets, carbon emissions, behavioural analytics, even the odd basketball game. These can be employed by any data scientist to help their data tell the right story to the right people.

Growing up by the mountains of Northern Greece, Hercules Konstantopoulos developed a fascination with the night sky and all its intrigue. After a career as a researcher in astrophysics that spanned ten years and four continents, he became drawn to addressing a greater variety of data-related problems. Data science ensued with work on sustainability and energy management, and now a spot as Sr Data Scientist at Atlassian, Sydney’s most acclaimed home-grown tech shop. There he focusses on converting support tickets and behavioural data into product strategy and business direction, and on creating informative and accessible data visualisation.

            <description><![CDATA[Join me for a scenic adventure tour through the magical land of category theory, stopping off at all the major sights.

We'll learn the basic notions that form the conceptual backbone of category theory, and how they all fit together.

Category theory has made deep inroads into computer science theory, but in this talk we'll be focused on computer science practice. We'll explore the advantages category theory brings to programming in terms of

1.providing alternate representations for types
2.  classifying solutions, or
3. simply providing a clarifying viewpoint and helping to organise our thinking.

In addition this should provide you with the right framework for further exploring category theory, should you so wish.

Mark has a PhD in algebra, writes Haskell at a bank, and loves functional programming.

There are lots of reasons using a cloud service is favorable, but how to make sure consistency between development and deployment? With Docker, we can "ship" the project to different platforms in the same environment. Going one step further we can also create the cloud infrastructure as code with Terraform. As an example, we will deploy a Jupyter notebook on Google Cloud Platform using both tools.

            <title><![CDATA[All that likelihood with PyMC3 - Junpeng Lao]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[PyData Berlin 2018

The likelihood is a central concept in Bayesian computation. In this tutorial, we will learn about what is the likelihood function and how do we use it for inference. Using PyMC3, I will demonstrate how to get the likelihood from a model, how does it connect to inference using NUTS or Variational approximation, and some practical usage of the model likelihood to perform model comparisons.

            <title><![CDATA[ctparse: a practical parser for natural language time expressions... - Dr  Sebastian Mika]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[PyData Berlin 2018

Parsing natural language time expressions into structured data is challenging. Whilst there are quite a few tools, many are either too simplistic or problematic in a python setup. ctparse is a pure python library (MIT-License) build on straight forward concepts, allowing to parse complex expressions efficiently and can easily be adjusted for domain specific use cases.
