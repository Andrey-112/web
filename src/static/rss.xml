Why learn Machine Learning with Python?

Data Science is a set of techniques that enable the computers to learn the desired behavior from data without explicitly being programmed. It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the broad areas of mathematics, statistics, information science, and computer science. This course exposes you to different classes of machine learning algorithms like supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement algorithms. This course imparts you the necessary skills like data pre-processing, dimensional reduction, model evaluation and also exposes you to different machine learning algorithms like regression, clustering, decision trees, random forest, Naive Bayes and Q-Learning.

            <title><![CDATA[2.5 Hour Symposium: Safety Culture, Lean, and DevOps]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[Dr. Sidney Dekker, Dr. Steven Spear, Dr. Richard Cook, John Willis and Gene Kim

As aspiring students of both Lean and Safety Culture, John Willis and I (Gene Kim) observed that there seemed to be many commonalities between the two movements of Safety Culture and Lean: the need for psychological safety, a scientific method for improvement daily work, systems thinking, and so forth. However, instead of these movements seeing the other as mutually supportive bodies of knowledge, they seemed to view the other with suspicion or even in diametric opposition.  

Over the last four years, John Willis and I (Gene Kim) have had the privilege of interacting with many of the most influential thinkers from these two movements. In 2017, John and I filmed a half-day panel with Dr. Richard Cook and Dr. Sidney Dekker from the Safety Culture movement, and Dr. Steven Spear from the Lean movement.

As John will tell you, on the one hand it was amazing to see such an intellectual tour de force of argumentation, citing philosophy, physics, management and social sciences, medicine, ethics, economics, and even theology. On the other hand, it was at times a pretty stressful and wild ride, and at one point, John and I wondered whether we should have let this stay buried in the desert, so vehement was the discussion. 

This full 2.5 hour dialogue was amazing to be part of, and listening to it always makes me feel smarter.  Certainly, by the end, it was clear that many principles and values span both Lean and safety culture.  

After this session, we filmed the 30m panel that has already been posted — it was  in front of the entire conference, and is posted here:: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFMJ3V4VakA.  I agree with my friend Charles Betz, who said, “This panel will go down in history as a watershed moment for the digital profession. Notable, in the fullest sense of the word.”]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[The Agile Transformation at ING]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[The CIO of ING presents on the Agile DevOps transformation and their focus on IT talent. http://ITRevolution.com. This is his presentation at the DevOps Enterprise Summit in London 2016.


Ron van Kemenade - Nothing Beats Engineering Talent…The AGILE Transformation at ING


ING’s Global Chief Information Officer (CIO) Ron van Kemenade overseas over 10,000 IT staff members (including externals.) He’s responsible for all banking technology at ING. ING serves over 34 million customers globally - showing that Agile transformation is scalable to large organizations.


Ron opened his presentation with the “We love IT” video highlighting ING’s milestones during the transition to DevOps. He goes on to explain that in order to serve ING’s mission of empowering people to stay a step ahead in life and business, their IT would need to change to serve that strategy.


After attending the Google I/O, Ron van Kemenade returned inspired to transform IT at ING. He started with a small mobile development team.


“If you want to make clear the impact of your change, you don’t put ten people in a row and all at the same time make a small step. Everybody moves at the same pace forward. So instead of that we asked one team to make a huge step forward. One meter in front of the other nine. Then everybody notices. And then you need to allow other teams to copy their behavior.


By focusing on internal talent, ING has become more responsive to customer needs.


Ron van Kemenade, CIO, ING Bank

            <title><![CDATA[YOW! Lambda Jam 2018 - Ryan Trinkle - Full-Stack Haskell, from Prototype to Production]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[Three years ago, I quit my job to bet everything on the proposition that Haskell could excel not just for specialized, high-assurance software, but for the kinds of software that millions of engineers work on every day. I had previously built backends with Haskell, with the wonderful experience of code that works reliably, a team that doesn't step on each others' toes, and an ease of refactoring that let us keep the codebase clean without risking regressions. But now, GHCJS and FRP had finally become reliable enough to trust in the real world. It was a game changer: Haskell could now build world-class graphical user interfaces, too, and deploy them as single page web apps — in theory.

In practice, there were many obstacles along the way. However, I found that even with the need to blaze new trails from time to time, our overall pace was far faster than anything I had seen in the imperative tech stacks I'd worked with before. Strong types and pure values decreased bug counts and made code much more readable. Some former backend developers who had scrupulously avoided frontend development told me that they now enjoyed working on the frontend, too.

Since then, I've worked with the community to continue building infrastructure to expand the areas where we can use Haskell to get real work done. Enabling mobile development required bug fixes to GHC, a rearchitected approach to cross-compilation in Nixpkgs, and bindings to native APIs. To scale up to larger projects, we've improved existing tools and created new tools that make developer workflows simpler, faster, and more discoverable. And to make Haskell app development more accessible to beginners and professionals without Haskell experience, we've made more and more functionality available out of the box.

In this talk, I'll show you the tools that are available today and the challenges that lie ahead. I hope you'll come away with a broadened understanding of how Haskell can be applied in your own professional projects — and how the theory of functional programming can be a potent practical tool.

Ryan Trinkle is a founding partner of Obsidian Systems, a software engineering consultancy that uses Haskell, Nix, and other functional tools to deliver better code faster and more predictably.  In 2015, he created Reflex, a Haskell-based functional reactive programming engine that now supports building desktop, web, and native mobile applications from a single codebase.  He has been a board member of Haskell.org since 2014 and was a founding member of the New York Haskell Users Group in 2012.  He holds degrees in law (J.D., Harvard '09) and computer science and computer systems engineering (B.S., Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute '05).

About Edureka Cyber Security Training

Cybersecurity is the combination of processes, practices, and technologies designed to protect networks, computers, programs, data and information from attack, damage or unauthorized access.

Edureka’s Cybersecurity Certification Course will help you in learning about the basic concepts of Cybersecurity along with the methodologies that must be practiced ensuring the information security of an organization. Starting from the Ground level Security Essentials, this course will lead you through Cryptography, Computer Networks & Security, Application Security, Data & Endpoint Security, idAM (Identity & Access Management), Cloud Security, Cyber-Attacks and various security practices for businesses.

------------------------------------------------

Why Learn Cyber Security?

Cybersecurity is the gathering of advances that procedures and practices expected to ensure systems, PCs, projects and information from assault, harm or unapproved get to. In a processing setting, security incorporates both cybersecurity and physical security, it is imperative since cyberattackers can without much of a stretch take and obliterate the profoundly grouped data of governments, defense offices and banks for which the results are huge so it is essential to have an appropriate innovation which an avoid digital wrongdoings.

---------------------------------------------------
