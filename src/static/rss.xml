            <description><![CDATA[Safely handling data that contains sensitive or private information about people is a multi-million dollar problem at many companies. It adds time into the data engineering process, it can cost a lot in software licenses for specialised tools, and brings a range of reputational and legal risks.

Recent advances in deep learning have prompted an interesting way to attack this problem. By fitting a certain class of model on a source data set that contains sensitive information, we can produce a generator that outputs a supply of synthetic "look alike" data. This output data will preserve many of the statistical relationships between fields as the source does, and offers mathematical guarantees around the identifiability of individuals in the source data set.

This talk will provide an overview of the approach and show how it can speed data engineering effort and reduce risk.

Tim is a Director at Verge Labs, a new type of AI company focused on the applied side of machine learning. At Verge Tim sifts through the daily firehose of theoretical research and builds a curated library of techniques and utilities ready to be switched on at companies today. 
 
Prior to this Tim spent six years absorbed in machine learning and data related roles in financial services tech companies including Atlassian, Spaceship and Airtasker.

            <description><![CDATA[From CSV, to JSON, to YAML, DER, and the dreaded XML, many programmers are dealing with data formats all day. In statically-typed languages like Haskell, we can get a great benefit by imposing a rigid structure of types on the data we consume from these formats. We call this process of imposing structure on data "decoding".

Decoding libraries are available in many languages and for many formats. This talk explores the design decisions behind a new Haskell library, sv, which decodes CSV and similar formats such as PSV. sv addresses what we perceived as problems with other libraries. We will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of the interesting or noteworthy choices made in sv's philosophy and design, and make recommendations as to how these lessons could be applied to other formats.

George is an enthusiastic programmer working at the Queensland Functional Programming Lab within Data61/CSIRO. George loves working with and speaking about Functional Programming, usually in Haskell. George is also a co-organiser of the Brisbane Functional Programming Group, and a member of the Haskell.org committee.

Customer Review: 
Michael Harkins, System Architect, Hortonworks says: “The courses are top rate. The best part is live instruction, with playback. But my favourite feature is viewing a previous class. Also, they are always there to answer questions, and prompt when you open an issue if you are having any trouble. Added bonus ~ you get lifetime access to the course you took!!! ~ This is the killer education app... I've taken two courses, and I'm taking two more.”]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[In a world where we are putting our companies data in the cloud, the protection of that data against a data breach has never been more important. In this talk I will show you how to setup and use the Microsoft Azure Key vault to protect your encryption keys and secrets like passwords and connection strings. Azure Key Vault uses the power of Hardware Security Modules (HSM's) to protect your secrets and make sure your solutions are as secure as they can be when working in regulated industries like healthcare, financial and insurance.
As well as showing you how to setup and configure the vault, I will show you how to code against it and various different patterns for security in a cloud base multi tenant environment. I will cover topics like:

• Setup Azure key Vault
• Authorize your application to access the vault with AzureAD
• Accessing the vault from your applications
• Using the Vault to wrap local encryption keys for performance
• Encrypting connection strings as Key Vault secrets to get flexible database routing in the cloud
• Audit logging for compliance

Once this talk is finished you will walk away with everything you need to start using Azure Key Vault today.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[In this 2015 GDC session, Fiction Control's Matthew Weise explains how clever uses of art, interface and UX can make an experience "cinematic" without ever having a single camera cut, and make players walk away feeling like they visited a movie like it was a place.

            <title><![CDATA[YOW! Lambda Jam 2018 - Brian McKenna - Teaching functional programming at Atlassian]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[My team works on Atlassian Marketplace, a project which started 10 years ago and uses Scala, Haskell and Nix. The Marketplace code uses concepts such as applicative functors, monad transformers and lenses. People joining the team mostly learned concepts as they needed to, through experimentation and asking questions.

Last year we started hosting functional programming classes for more fundamental and broad understanding. We've been using the Data61 (formerly NICTA) Functional Programming Course with a lot of success. This talk will describe how we teach FP, what we've learned about teaching FP and the challenges we face.

Brian's specialties: Functional programming, Haskell, PureScript, Idris, Agda, Scala, JavaScript, Emacs, Git

            <title><![CDATA[YOW! Data 2018 - Gala Camacho - Place Activity During the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[Why do people choose to live in one neighbourhood over another? Every day government makes decisions that can change the way a neighbourhood operates and feels. Understanding the impact that these decisions have is convoluted and hard to measure.

In April, the Gold Coast held the 2018 Commonwealth Games. These events, usually advertised as urban renewal or regeneration projects, have a lasting impact on the neighbourhoods where they take place. Usually, there is a strong push to predic the impact of the games through economic assessments and surveys, however, once the games are happening, is that impact tracked? Sometimes, further economic assessments are produced years after the event which evaluate whether the impact was as expected. Can we do better?

Social data can provide us with more timely evidence of whether the event is activating the economy as expected, or maybe highlight issues that can be resolved.

Using social media data we will explore Facebook places data during and after the games, ultimately generating a dashboard to help us visualise change by giving us the ability to filter and aggregate the data. We will manage the data using Python’s Pandas, generate quick visualisations using Plotly, and finish off by spinning up a dashboard using Plotly’s Dash.

Gala is a mathematician and programmer using data analytics to improve the way we understand cities. With a diverse background in secondary education, volunteering, optimisation and all-things data, Gala is enthusiastic to find solutions to interesting problems and innovative ways to visualise data.

At Neighbourlytics, Gala investigates what information can be extracted from urban data sources to define and visualise the unique local identity of a neighbourhood.

Gala is driven to positively impact her community through her skills and her voice. As such, she is involved with multiple organisations aimed at making the world (but particularly, the tech-world) a better place for women.

            <title><![CDATA[Ruby After 25 Years by the Creator of Ruby]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[Two things are apparent when watching Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto, creator of Ruby programming language, talk on the stage. First, that he will do anything he can to enable Ruby to survive and thrive and, second, that he’s thoroughly enjoying himself doing what he does. He’s passionate about Ruby and its community and his outlook is quite simple: Programming is fun, he’s had fun for the last 25 years making Ruby and at the age of 52 now, he hopes that he’ll get to spend the next 25 years having as much fun working on the language he dreamt up and wrote down in – a now lost – notebook, at the age of 17.

EVENT:

Engineering.SG Meetup 2018

Yukihiro Matsumoto (Matz), creator of Ruby
