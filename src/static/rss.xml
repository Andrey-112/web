Speaker: Venkat Subramaniam
No Slides at speaker request
There is a good amount of excitement about the new version of Java. The big evolution of course is the lambda expressions. In this presentation we will dive into the language features in Java 8, take a look at some of their nuances, and look at ways to put them to good use. In addition to looking at lambdas we will also dive into the Streams capabilities and also some of the features in Java 8 that make all these possible.

            <description><![CDATA[Recorded at SpringOne2GX 2013 in Santa Clara, CA.
Speaker: Ben Hale
As data-driven applications become more widespread, the services that provide the data are becoming more critical. Most commonly these data services are exposed via REST-ful APIs. This session describes what exactly makes a service REST-ful, how to implement a REST-ful API using Spring, and how to test that API.

            <description><![CDATA[Recorded at SpringOne 2GX 2012.
Speaker: Gil Tene, Azul Systems
Garbage Collection is an integral part of application behavior on Java platforms, yet it is often misunderstood. As such, it is important for Java developers to understand the actions you can take in selecting and tuning collector mechanisms, as well as in your application architecture choices. In this session, Gil Tene (CTO, Azul Systems) will review and classify the various garbage collectors and collection techniques available in JVMs today. Following a quick overview of common garbage collection techniques including generational, parallel, stop-the-world, incremental, concurrent and mostly-concurrent algorithms, we will define terms and metrics common to all collectors. We will classify each major JVM collector's mechanisms and characteristics and discuss the tradeoffs involved in balancing requirements for responsiveness, throughput, space, and available memory across varying scale levels. We will conclude with some pitfalls, common misconceptions, and "myths" around garbage collection behavior, as well as examples of how some good choices can result in impressive application behavior.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Recorded at SpringOne Platform 2016.
Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/developing-microservices-with-aggregates

The Domain Model pattern is a great way to develop complex business logic.

Unfortunately, a typical domain model is a tangled, birds nest of classes.

It can’t be decomposed into microservices.

Moreover, business logic often relies on ACID transactions to maintain consistency.

Fortunately, there is a solution to this problem: aggregates.

An aggregate is an often overlooked modeling concept from the must read book Domain Driven Design.

In this talk you will learn how aggregates enable you to develop business logic for the modern world of microservices and NoSQL.

We will describe how to use aggregates to design modular business logic that can be partitioned into microservices. You will learn how aggregates enable you to use eventual consistency instead of ACID.

We will describe the design of a microservice that is built using aggregates, and Spring Cloud.]]></description>

Big Data Track
Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/developing-realtime-data-pipelines-with-apache-kafka-53201942
Developing Real-Time Data Pipelines with Apache Kafka http://kafka.apache.org/ is an introduction for developers about why and how to use Apache Kafka. Apache Kafka is a publish-subscribe messaging system rethought of as a distributed commit log. Kafka is designed to allow a single cluster to serve as the central data backbone. A single Kafka broker can handle hundreds of megabytes of reads and writes per second from thousands of clients. It can be elastically and transparently expanded without downtime. Data streams are partitioned and spread over a cluster of machines to allow data streams larger than the capability of any single machine and to allow clusters of coordinated consumers. Messages are persisted on disk and replicated within the cluster to prevent data loss. Each broker can handle terabytes of messages. For the Spring user, Spring Integration Kafka and Spring XD provide integration with Apache Kafka.]]></description>

Core Spring Track
Spring Security is a framework that focuses on providing both authentication and authorization to Java applications. Like all Spring projects, the real power of Spring Security is found in how easily it can be extended to meet custom requirements. In this presentation Rob will start with an insecure application and incrementally Spring Security 4 to demonstrate how easily you can secure your application. Throughout the presentation, new features found in Spring Security 4 will be highlighted. Whether you are new to Spring Security or are wanting to learn what is new in Spring Security 4, this presentation is a must!]]></description>

Speakers: Dr. Dave Syer, Josh Long
Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/getting-started-with-spring-cloud
Spring Cloud 1.0 is here! It offers a powerful way to create and consume microservices. As you introduce new services, you introduce integration problems: services can be shaky, they can disappear and - as they're often exposed over HTTP - they require a bit more footwork than in-process method invocations. In this webinar, we'll focus specifically on how Spring Cloud integrates service registration (e.g. Eureka), declarative REST clients (with Netflix's Feign), reactive programming and the circuit breaker pattern with Hystrix to support easy, robust service-to-service invocations, and messaging microservices with Spring Cloud Stream. This is a deep dive on how to make connect and consume microservices, and is a natural next step after the introduction to building microservices with Spring Boot.]]></description>

Speaker: Michael Ploed

Slides: http://www.slideshare.net/SpringCentral/building-microservices-with-event-sourcing-and-cqrs-53211567
CQRS and Event Sourcing are two architectural patterns that have become very popular through the rise of cloud architectures and No-SQL databases. Both work very well together and take a different take at the handling and storage of data compared to the "classic enterprise approach". CQRS splits your application in a read- and a write-part whereas through Event Sourcing the state of your data is represented by sequences of events. This talk introduces both patterns and shows how applications leveraging CQRS and Event Sourcing can be implemented with the Spring Ecosystem.The talk will have slides and live demos.]]></description>

Speaker: Rob Winch
Spring Security is a framework that focuses on providing both authentication and authorization to Java applications. Like all Spring projects, the real power of Spring Security is found in how easily it can be extended to meet custom requirements. In this presentation Rob will incrementally apply Spring Security to an existing application to demonstrate how it can meet your authentication and authorization needs. It will also answer many of the common "how to" questions that are found on the forums. This will ensure that you can not only secure your application quickly, but ensure you understand Spring Security well enough to extend it to meet your custom requirements.

"It is not necessary to change. Survival is not mandatory.” -W. Edwards Deming

Work takes time to flow through an organization and ultimately be deployed to production where it captures value. It’s critical to reduce time-to-production. Software - for many organizations and industries - is a competitive advantage. Organizations break their larger software ambitions into smaller, independently deployable, feature -centric batches of work - microservices. In order to reduce the round-trip between stations of work, organizations collapse or consolidate as much of them as possible and automate the rest; developers and operations beget “devops,” cloud-based services and platforms (like Cloud Foundry) automate operations work and break down the need for ITIL tickets and change management boards. But velocity, for velocity’s sake, is dangerous. Microservices invite architectural complexity that few are prepared to address. In this talk, we’ll look at how high performance organizations like Ticketmaster, Alibaba, and Netflix make short work of that complexity with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.]]></description>

Speaker: Ben Hale
In the course of creating VAS, we did a lot of work to design a useful REST API. REST is generally a very loose collection of principals that can be interpreted in many ways, so this talk would describe a more concrete idea of what a REST-ful API should look like.  In addition, the implementation of this API was done with many of the new features in Spring 3 and are a good demonstration of the power it provides.]]></description>
